# Little Lemon Restaurant

Little Lemon Restaurant is a front-end development capstone project under the Meta Upskill 2022 course.

It is a React-powered website developed for the Little Lemon restaurant to display their special menu and reserve a table online.

This project is a final test to evaluate the course learners' understanding and knowledge of the front-end development course and to develop a functional website powered by React.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies
The project is built with:
- React 18.2.0
- Simple HTML and CSS
- JavaScript

## Problem
The Little Lemon Restaurant wants to have a website that has features such as reserving a table online. However, such features have not been implemented, and customers are complaining to the restaurant about the inconvenience. The objective of this project is to create a website with a function that allows users to reserve a table online.

## Approach
The project specifies to use React and any necessary modules (e.g., react-router-dom and jest) to develop a functional feature that allows users to easily reserve a table online.

## Setup
In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone`

Clones the project repository as a local copy to your machine.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
