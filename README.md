# Little Lemon with React

A project under the Meta Upskill 2022’s Front-end Developer Capstone course to assess the knowledge and understanding I learnt about the React framework.

Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that serves traditional recipes with a modern twist.

The restaurant wants a website that can allow its customers to easily reserve a table online.

Thus, the project aims to develop such a website with React and fulfil the features that the restaurant desires.

It is created with React and other libraries such as ChakraUI, Formik, and Yup.
